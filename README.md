👋 Hi, I'm Marco
---

I’m currently:
- 🔭 Doing research on **semantics of programming languages**, **mathematics** and **logic** for computation. 
- 🌱 Teaching **theory and practice of concurrency**, **quantum computing**, and **programming languages**.  
- 💻 Developing research and hobby projects such as:
  - 🌀 [**rec-schemes**](https://github.com/mpaviotti/rec-schemes): a Haskell library for **recursion schemes**, enabling elegant and compositional approaches to recursion and program structure.  
  - ⚙️ [**Markix**](https://github.com/mpaviotti/Markix): a minimalist **operating system** written from scratch in C and x86 assembly, used to explore low-level architecture, bootloaders, interrupts, and schedulers.  
- 👯 Looking to collaborate on research connecting **category theory**, **semantics**, and **computation**.  
- 🤔 Looking for help with doing **OS development** and connections with **formal semantics**
- 💬 Ask me about **denotational semantics**, **lambda calculus**, **monads**, or how interrupts and schedulers actually work at the hardware level.  
- 📫 How to reach me: [marco.paviotti@gmail.com](mailto:marco.paviotti@gmail.com)  
- ⚡ Fun fact: I switch between **proof assistants** and **assembly debuggers** with equal joy

### 🧩 Featured Project: Markix OS

### 🌀 [rec-schemes](https://github.com/mpaviotti/rec-schemes)
A Haskell library implementing **recursion schemes**, providing elegant combinators for expressing recursive algorithms compositionally.  
Inspired by category theory, this project explores how **functors**, **algebras**, and **coalgebras** capture recursion in a principled way.

### ⚙️ [Markix](https://github.com/mpaviotti/Markix)
A minimalist **operating system** written in C and x86 assembly.  
Markix boots from scratch, sets up the **GDT**, **interrupts**, and a **round-robin scheduler**, showing the structure of an OS from the ground up.  
Aimed at educational and experimental exploration of **protected mode**, **multitasking**, and **low-level OS internals**.

### ⚙️ [OSDev Notes](https://github.com/mpaviotti/osdev-notes)
A TeX written notes to write an Intel x86 operating system from scratch written in C and x86 assembly.
